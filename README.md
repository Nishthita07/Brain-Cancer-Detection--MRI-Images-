# Brain-Cancer Detection using MRI-Images

This project focuses on automated brain cancer detection using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans through advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The model is trained to identify and classify brain tumors from MRI images with high accuracy, aiding early diagnosis and improving patient care.

Features

-Preprocessing of MRI images (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization)

-Automated brain tumor detection and classification

-Model trained on labeled MRI image datasets

-High accuracy with minimal false positives

-Easy integration with medical software or diagnostic platforms

Model Architecture

-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based architecture for image classification

-Data augmentation for improved generalization

-Optionally uses transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet)

-Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Dataset

MRI brain scan dataset (e.g., from Kaggle, BraTS, or other open medical sources)

Images labeled as:

-No Tumor

-Glioma Tumor

-Meningioma Tumor

-Pituitary Tumor
